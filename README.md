Version 1-27-26 Uploaded by Roer from Roer's Orange laptop
   Significant amount of changes -- rewritten to post everything to Network Tables by way of Epilogue and @Logged lines
   Eliminated most of the old subsystems
   No vision code at this time -- It wasn't really working in the 1-23 version anyway.

Version 1-23-26 - Uploaded by Roer from Bangma's laptop #45. 
  Initial import of patches code from last year into wpilib 2026. 
  Some attempts at creating a vision subsystem utilizing our limelights exist, but they are a mess and need to be deleted and started over.
  We ran into issues with limelights not talking to code, but ultimately found the problem was in a poorly assigned ip address.
